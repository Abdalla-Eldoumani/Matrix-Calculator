1. Introduction
This documentation covers the details and implementation of the Matrix Calculator Project. The purpose of this project is to provide an online tool for performing matrix calculations.

2. Features
The Matrix Calculator offers the following features:
Matrix Input: Users can input two matrices and specify their dimensions.
Calculations: Perform basic matrix operations.
Result Display: Displays the result in a formatted matrix structure.

3. Project Structure
Sidebar: Contains the title of the application and navigation links. It is fixed on larger screens and becomes static on smaller ones.

Main Content:
Matrix Input Forms (matrix-formA and matrix-formB)
Action Buttons: Perform matrix operations.
Result Display: Display the result in a grid structure.

4. Design and Styling
The design follows a modern and user-friendly approach:
Colors: A gradient background, ranging from light blue to deep blue, is used to give a dynamic look.
Typography: The default font is Arial. Different font sizes are used to distinguish between headers and content.
Buttons: Designed to be prominent and interactive, with a hover effect.

5. Responsiveness
The website is designed to be responsive, catering to both desktop and mobile users:
Desktop View: Sidebar is fixed to the left, with main content adjacent to it.
Mobile & Tablet View (up to 768px wide):
The sidebar becomes static and occupies the full width.
Main content appears below the sidebar, with reduced padding and margins for optimal space usage.
Font sizes are adjusted for readability.
The design utilizes CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styling based on the device's screen width.

6. Future Improvements
While the current version of the Matrix Calculator serves its primary function, there's potential for further enhancements:

Enhanced Calculations: Integration of more complex matrix operations.

User Profiles: Allow users to create profiles to save and retrieve previous matrix calculations.

Tutorials & Guides: Introduce a section that educates users about matrix operations and their applications.
